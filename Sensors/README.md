## Position part and How to change position
For now the threshold to check dancer is dancing = 10000  
Run the code and open the Serial port  
  
  
dancing -> turn left/right **slowly** -> walk 2/3 steps -> turn back  
  
can change line *249, 252, 256, 267* to fine tune the detection  
All the offset values are documented in calibrationValue file and set in the code alr.
