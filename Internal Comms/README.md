# Internal_Comms

To run the laptop code and connect to the external comms code (Extcomms.py), make sure that the laptop code (laptop.py) is connecting to the same port number and local host as the external comms code.  

NOTE: 
Do state the dancer id before executing the laptop code.


e.g. DANCER_ID=1 python3 laptop.py
